# Why This Subject? 

Six introductions, the last one actually has engineering principles.

The rest are "just" poetry, thigns I need to get out of my system.

## Beyond Magic

I ran my first decision tree learner in 1980s. It was amazing: structure dribbling out
from samples of data-- the thrill of (possibly) discovering something no one has ever seen before.

Decades later, that thrill remains. BUT. There has to be more.  Given all that experience with induction,
what might we say about the nature of learning NOW that we did not know before?

## Fear

Newbies think data mining is running simple queries like `age > 21`.

But the more you work it, the more intricate it becomes. Choice of data, choice of goals, interaction
with users, feedback from business uers, choice of learners,
data pre-processing, trying different learners, choice of statistical methods-- 
[all these effect what gets learned](https://github.com/txt/ase15/blob/master/models/icse14-v5-min.py).

I've watched 100 graduate students botch up data miners. 

## Worried about Continuous Deloymemt



## Engineering Details

Here's  my standard toolkit for exploring data. Note the commitmnet to various
data structures and algorithms. You can, and you should, critize those choices
(and run experiments on different choices). 

Regardless of the _how_, I hope you reflect much on the _why_ of the following;
i.e.

- no data mining without verification</em> and <em> before anything else, design for verification</em>.
