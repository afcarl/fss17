##  Theory

1. Explain: DE's build new examples by extrapolating between known ones.
    - how does this method maintain associations between variables?
1. Explain the following DE constants:
    - What is np and how is it used?
    - What is cf and how is it used?
    - What is f and how is it used?
1. For each of np,cf,f what would happen in
   those values were doubled or halved?
1. Give a reasonable size for the frontier with respect to the number of decisions

## Practice

1. Write down, in 10 lines or less, pseudo-code for extrapolation in DE.
