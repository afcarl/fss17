Mid-session exam week 10 (on terminology)   
No final exam.  

### Overview

**Synopsis:** 
"Science" is the process of communities sharing and reviewing and
improving each other’s ideas. Sadly, most "data science" is not about
"science". Rather its about vendors selling you stuff that does not
work properly and does not ring an alarm when it starts failing.  This
is strange since an important part of knowledge is "no"; i.e. the
ability to critically assess something, and to recognize when one idea
is better, smarter, than another.
So a million million people can run data miners. But how many now when
those data miners start going wrong? And how to fix faulty models?
Do this subject, learn answers to those questions. Become the data
scientist everyone needs to consult with when things start going
wrong.

**Objectives:** By the end of the course, students should be able to:
 
+ Build data miners from scratch
+ Customize data miners to serve the needs of communities reviewer and improving each other models.
+ Report on complex technical  issues (spoken talk)
+ Report on complex technical  issues (written talk)

+ Office Hours: Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 and by request
+ Location of Office Hours: EE II room 3298 
+ E-Mail: tim.menzies@gmail.com 
  + Only use this email for private matters. All other class communication should be via the class Slack group [http://fss17.slack.com](http://fss17.slack.com).
+ Phone: 304-376-2859
       + **Do not use** this number, except in the most dire of 
          circumstances (best way to contact me is via email).



**Group mailing list:** During term time, all communication will be via
the Slack group https://fss17.slack.com.
. Students are strongly encouraged to contribute their questions and answers to that shared resource.
+ Note that, for communication of a more private nature, contact the lecturer on the email shown above.

**Topics:** Overview, methods for implementing comprehensible, fast, RAM-light, goal-aware, certification envelopers, context-aware, privacy-aware,
anomaly-aware, sharable, self-tuning, incremental data mining methods.



**Projecti:** Students will implement and assess some of the above operators in a domain
of their own choosing (ideally, some model relating to software engineering). Note that:

+ CSC 791 Ph.d. student will work alone
+ CSC 591 masters students will work in groups of three.

**Prerequisite:** Note that this is a
**programming-intensive** subject. A programming
background is required in a contemporary language
such as Java or C/C++ or Python. Hence,he
prerequisite for this class is 510, Software
Engineering. Significant software industry
experience may be substituted, at the instructor’s
discretion.  Students in this class will work in
Python, but no background knowledge of that language
will be assumed.

**Suggested texts:** none
  absolute latest version of this book.

**Expected Workload:** 
Sometimes, the lecturer/tutor will require you to attend a review session during their consultation  time. There, students may be asked to review
code, concepts, or comment on the structure of the course. Those sessions are mandatory and failure to attend will result in marks being deducted.

Also, this is tools-based subject
and it is required that students learn and use those
tools (Python, repositories, etc).  Students MUST be
prepared to dedicate AT LEAST 5-8 working hours a
week to this class (excluding the time spent in the
classroom). Laboratory instruction is not included
in this subject (but the first three weeks will be
spent on some in-depth programming tutorials). Note
that the workload for masters and Ph.D. students
will be different (see above).

**Grading:** The following grade scale will be used: 

+ A+  (97-100), A (93-96), A-(90-92)
+ B+ (87-89), B (83-86), B-(80-82)
+ C+ (77-79), C (73-76), C-(70-72)
+ D+ (67-69), D (63-66), D-(60-62)
+ F (below 60).

Grades will be added together using:


+ Homeworks : 25 marks (5 homerowks  5 marks each)
+ Exam week 10 (on terminology): 15  marks
+ Paper (on current  directions in foundations of software science): 20 marks
    - Masters students have to survey existing approaches 
    - Ph.D. students must (a) survey _and_ (b) critically evaluate _and_ (c) propose
      new directions
+ Big project (on automated SE): 20 (essay) 10 (presentation) 10 (code review)
    - The code review will be the lecturer reading the code checking that the implementation is above a minimum level of effort.
    - Masters student have to motivate their design choices and demonstrate a a working system
    - Ph.D. students have to (a) motivate their work and (b) demonstrate more than one working systemsand
      (c) critically compare and contrasts these N methods.

The mid-term exam will be on Tues Oct 17 (1 hour, rest of class canceled).


### Homeworks  and Project

Schedule:

- August  will be introductory lectures.
  - Semi-weekly homeworks start Aug 29 and are due Aug29, Sept12, Sept10,Sept26, Oct5.
  - October is for the big project, due Nov 14
  - November is for the big essay on current directions in software science, due Dec1. 
      - Meanwhile, all groups will present their work (each talk= 15 minites) 

Homeworks:

+ All deliverables are group-based (one deliverable per group)
  + 500-level students: groups of three
  + 700-level students: groups of one
+ Homeworks will be written into a public Github repo which students will create.
+ Students will shorten the url (using something like tiny.cc) of the the main file of each homework submission
    + That url wull be pasted into the spreadsheet http://tiny.cc/fss17give
+ Homeworks will be  worth 5 marks
+ Students cannot do homework <em>i+1</em> till  homework <em>i</em> gets at least 4 marks
+ Homeworks can be submitted multiple times
  + No late penalties
  + No points taken off for repeat submissions
  + ESSENTIAL: Students must submit (or resubmit) at least one item per week (or lose 2 marks)

### Attendance

Attendance is extremely important for your learning
experience in this class. Once you reach three
unexcused absences, each additional absence will
reduce your attendance grade by 10%.

Except for officially allowed reasons, your presence in the class if required from day one. 
Late-comers will have to work in their own solo groups (to avoid disruptions to existing groups).

Note that absences for weddings (your own, or someone else's, is not an offically allowed reason).

Exceptions: this subject  will support students who are absent for any of the following
officially allowed reasons:

- Anticipated Absences (cleared with the instructor before the absence).
Examples of anticipated situations include
    - representing an official university function, e.g., participating in a professional meeting, as part of a judging team, or athletic team;
    - required court attendance as certified by the Clerk of Court;
    - religious observances as verified by the Division of Academic and Student Affairs (DASA).
    - Required military duty as certified by the student's commanding officer.
- Unanticipated Absences.  Excuses must be reported to the instructor not more than one week after the return to class.  Examples of unanticipated absences are:
      -  Short-term illness or injury affecting the ability to attend or to be productive academically while in class, or that could jeopardize the health of the individual or the health of the classmates attending.  Students must notify instructors prior to the class absence, if possible, that they are temporarily unable to attend class or complete assignments on time.
      -  Death or serious illnesses in the family when documented appropriately.  An attempt to verify deaths or serious illness will be made by the Division of Academic and Student Affairs.

That support will include changing the schedule of deliverables and/or (in extreme
case) different grading arrangements.


### Academic Integrity

Cheating will be punished to the full extent permitted. Cheating
includes plagerism of other people's work. All students will be working
on public code repositories and **informed reuse** is encouraged where
someone else's product is:

+ Imported and clearly acknowledged (as to where it came from);
+ The imported project is understood, and
+ The imported project is significantly extended.

Students are encouraged to read each others code and repor **uninformed reuse**
to the lecturer. The issue will be explored and, if uncovered,
cheating will be reported to the university
and marks will be deducted if the person who is doing the reuse:

+ Does not acknowledge the source of the product;
+ Does not exhibit comprehension of the product when asked about it;
+ Does not significantly extend the product.

All students are expected to maintain traditional
standards of academic integrity by giving proper
credit for all work.  All suspected cases of
academic dishonesty will be aggressively pursued.
You should be aware of the University policy on
academic integrity found in the Code of Student
Conduct.
 
The  exams will be done individually.  Academic integrity is important.  Do not work together on the exams: cheating on either will be punished to the full extent permitted.  

### Disabilities

Reasonable accommodations will be made for students
with verifiable disabilities. In order to take
advantage of available accommodations, students must
