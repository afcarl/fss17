title: Stats that make a difference
---


my Spiel would be cognitive. that stats are "m'eh" but the real game is showing decision makers  things that let them do things. so informative "visualizations" that highligtht the deltas between things (Kelly's personnel construct theory: folks dont know "things", what they really know are the minimal differences between things) .

which leads to the mathematics of diversity (entropy, variance) and how to distinguish between things (bootstrapping, effectSize) and how to apply that theory of differences to data mining (clustering, discretization, recursive tree learning).  

the final cherry on this cake would be scott-knot stuff seen at icse recently where  results are chunked up into BIG groups and we no longer focus on micro deltas but on BIG MOFO DIFFERENCES.
